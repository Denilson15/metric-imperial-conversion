# Metric-Imperial Conversion

This is a custom-built unit conversion tool developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building interactive web applications and managing user input.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://reliable-tartufo-af5917.netlify.app/](https://reliable-tartufo-af5917.netlify.app/)

This project showcases a functional unit converter that allows users to convert values between metric and imperial units. It includes:

- An input field to enter numerical values
- Real-time conversion results displayed for various units
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users enter a numerical value into the input field.
- JavaScript captures the input and performs conversions between metric and imperial units.
- The results are dynamically displayed on the page, updating in real-time as the user types.
- The application uses basic arithmetic operations for unit conversions without relying on external libraries.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented real-time conversion logic in JavaScript
- Ensured responsiveness across various screen sizes

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add support for additional units and conversion types
- Implement input validation and error handling
- Enhance the user interface with improved styling and animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `index.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript for handling user input and conversions
- `vite.config.js` – Configuration for Vite

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denilson15/metric-imperial-conversion.git
cd metric-imperial-conversion
npm install
npm start
